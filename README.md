Hi , some of you might seen my support for UKM in general and for OnePlus devices.

I have always liked to use UKM and Synapse from one simple reason :

- UKM is one of most powerfull and flexible zip that let you control kernel parameters.

This project is nothing else than carrying forward original UKM created by @apb_axel and @ak and all credits belong to them.

Original UKM thread - [https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/zip-synapse-script-universal-kernel-t2736986](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/zip-synapse-script-universal-kernel-t2736986)

### What is all about?
